# cnn_project
This is completely a deep learning project entirely based on neural networks and I think Facial emotion recognition(FER) project is one of the classical projects in deep learning.

We all know facial emotions play a vital role in our day-to-day life. so, we need a system which is capable of recognising our facial emotions and able to act accordingly.

This project is the first step in that system.
